## [Midnight Assessment]
***
I had to complete an online assessment by gs, and the deadline is on Feb, 7th. I sent they emails to ask if the deadline could be postpond 
because I have some exams these days. Yet I didnt receive reply from they until I finished everything. 

I started the test around 11:45 pm, and it lasted for 90 minutes. It quite tide and I would suggest use java for programming for the user friendly 
programming model.
