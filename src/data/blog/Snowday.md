[*Today is a snow day*]
***
 
Today is a snow day also the third day I started no phone experiment
. Everything went on okay, I tried the late night dining place at foster west hall, I kept forget about the
names about this hall because I just didn't pay attention. But thanks to no phone experiment, kept thinking of it when I walk
So I really remember it.

I was very surprised by how my bike was covered under the snow when I try to ride back.

I started plan that no work after 7pm, but my little research.
