[*Today is a snow day*]
***
 
Today is a snow day also the third day I started no phone experiment
. Everything went on okay, I tried the late night dining place at foster west hall, I kept forgetting about the
name of this hall because I just didn't pay attention. But thanks to no phone experiment, I kept thinking of it when I walked
So I really remembered it.

I didn't even use alarm anymore and just wake up when I do, the first thing I do is not reach for my phone, but really plan for the day,
that's good.

I tried not to write everything about the day, like how I likes a girl, how I find the type of girls I do like, or how I chocked everytime I speak to others.

I decided to call my parents since I haven't talked to anyone for a day, we talked about how things changed since ncov virus.

I was very surprised by how my bike was covered under the snow when I try to ride back.

I started plan that no work after 7pm, but my little research. 

Alright I had to catch an early bus to Chicago tomorrow, so sleeping now!
