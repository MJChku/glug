## Cost of Perfection in Transformation
Among the stories I love the swan lake and birthmark most, because they are more complex, odd and astonishing in some sense. The topic is inspired by how protagonists hold on to their believes while go through the tortures. Those believes are certainly twisted if put in real life, but the very truth that they exist only in stories bolsters their attractiveness.  

The protagonists in those stories all move toward perfection, regardless of some failure. But charming stories cloak the complex reasons of transformation and true reasons for enduring the cost.  Whether roles in the stories noticed the cost or they were just never able to perceive it, the cost did come in the process and they stick to the transformation regardless the risk. And it would be worth to investigate the reasons. 

In the movie, black swan, the superficial drive toward perfection in both white and black swan is Nina’s imperfection. But what Nina aspires to is swan queen with which perfection in both black and white swan serves as a requirement. It is worth noting that Nina does not know the cost ahead of transformation as when she demonstrates to Thomas for the first time, she was interrupted by Lily(the black swan), but in her mind, she would be great in dancing black swan without interruption, proved by her practice at home and trying to tell Thomas that she succeeded. In her conversation with Thomas, Thomas tells Nina that being perfect in black swan is about losing herself, and Nina defends her obsessing getting each and every move perfectly right in 4 years by “I just want to be perfect” (Black Swan). The perfection in Nina’s speech here is only about dance all right but the perfection in the transformation is more about possessing black swan, which requires endogenous change or more precisely, forgo of control. The cost as losing herself is not what she wants. But it is not clear whether Nina perceives the cost or not. The argument can be, if Nina knows the cost and she insists to transform which will mean that Nina is actively embracing personality of Lily who is black swan, the vague part is what attitude of Nina toward Lily is. Nina is frightened whenever she sees the sign of black swan, like the chuckling and the face, which contradicts to “embracing personality of Lily”, while at the same time Nina is actively hanging out with Lily. It is hard to reject either assumption, as in the transforming process Nina is volatile plus the disease (Vanier and Searight) which allows different attitudes coexist. I prefer Nina perceives the cost. She was forced, by Lily putting pills in her drink, or fatefully affected by black swan and she perceives the change happening on herself, but the desire to be swan queen overwhelm the resistance and the cost. Another interpretation is “Nina is fighting between the persona of an innocent perfectionist and the impulsive, emotional self she has never faced before” (Vanier and Searight); that black swan is a potential of Nina and in her transformation, she is just getting used to the persona which she has hidden for a long time. Or she is shedding the cloak of girlhood gradually. In this sense, cost comes from adaptation and growth, and she perceives it. 

In the story of TuTzuchun, the protagonist knows the cost of transformation as he was told by Taoist, he held a positive attitude toward the cost of transformation, to see but not to perceive, to perceive but not to react; which is different from Nina’s attitude, as argued before, vague and complex. Also, In the story of Pygmalion, it seems as a perfect transformation for a statue to a live creature, while Pygmalion is addicted to the beauty of the statue and the illusion that he and the statue go along well, indicated by “he kissed the statue and was sure it kissed him back”(Ovid), personality of the live statue is a risk that he never thinks of. He loves the appearance and perceived an illusionary but lovely personality which is implicated by his interaction with the statue and may not be true. Uncertainty is a risk and thus a cost, but he is so addicted to the statue, as well as addiction of Nina to swan queen, that they precede with it. 

But the attitude of Aylmer in story of Birth Mark is firm. The cost is not clear as the transformation of Georgiana happens as soon as she drinks the potion and only by then comes the cost. But they might be aware of it as in Aylmer’s dream, it says, “but the deeper went the knife, the deeper sank the hand(birthmark on cheek), until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have caught hold of Georgiana’s heart”(Hawthorne) and in Aylmer’s words saying that “your case demands a remedy that shall go deeper”(Hawthorne). Even though the mark is on Georgiana’s cheek, it seems Aylmer knows the cost better and Aylmer tells Georgiana that the hand has clutched its grasp into Georgiana’s being with strength of which he had no previous conception (Hawthorne). Also, though, Georgiana has mentioned several times removing her mark at expense of even her life, does not mean she knows the cost clearly. The thing worth considering is what if both of them know the cost for certain or nearly certain, would they still do the experiment?  

The discussion is really related to their transformation goal. If the goal of the trial at cost of life is about perfection, it shall not be conducted as perfection without life is nothing.  But if the goal of the trial and of the transformation is not purely perfection, things will be different.  For Aylmer, his goal is to prove science over nature. Supported by his exclaim that “what will be my triumph when I shall have corrected what Nature left imperfect in her fairest work” (Hawthorne). Perfection of his wife’s face is merely a carrier of his ambition in science. The proof is his kiss at the birthmark, originated from “Yet once, by a strange and unaccountable impulse, he pressed it with his lips ”(Hawthorne). If he is really pursuing perfection or beauty, he should not change his attitude about the disgusting mark that he is not able to face. Why would he even kiss that thing? Because he treated the mark as a chance of proving his intelligence in science by removing it. He rather treats the mark separately from his wife.   

For Georgiana, her attitude changes overtime. At first, she wants to remove the mark as her beloved husband hated that mark but she loves it. In the process, she is frightened by Aylmer’s experiment and afraid to lose her life, then hated that hand even more than Aylmer as they proceed. But near end, she admires Aylmer more both in his love and work, that she proactively risks her life for Aylmer’s work. From being depressed by Aylmer’s feeling about her birthmark, to the complement that “she felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her sake” (Hawthorne), Georgiana is ready for the cost. And thus, both of them would still conduct the experiment if they had known the cost.    

Kisses across the stories serve as a sign of telling the truth and revealing the heart, as kiss is often time an impulsive action if not with love. At the end of black swan, Nina kissed Thomas heavily but left no affection on Nina’s face, rather it’s proud. The whole transforming process of Nina serves as a proof of Nina’s eligibility to dance the swan queen, and Thomas is the one who is not satisfied by her performance initially. But is the goal of Nina really perfection? In general sense, yes; through mirror Nina or many dancers, see both the ideal version of themselves which they dream of on stage as well as their flaws. The goal is conquering that flaw. Black Nina in the mirror acts independently, while still a reflection of her flaw. Obsessed in the perfect imaginary self in the mirror, what drives to physical perfection drives Nina mad. Then all black things come as consequence. In another way, those elusive black things are what Nina aims to embrace. Nina’s final goal is rebellion, forgoing control, impulse meanwhile perfection comes as a reward. Either way, when Nina kissed Thomas, perfection has been reached at the moment. But chaos and madness will entangle with Nina’s life as long as its length. 

Finally, after enduring all the cost in the transformation towards perfection, dream of perfection perishes on wake of success. No matter protagonists had known previously or not, they would comprehend the cost at that moment.
