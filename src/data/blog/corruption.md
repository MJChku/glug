## Connection and Reflection on Corruption and Economic Growth   

In the book “A Double Paradox”, it says, in economy, negative relationship between corruption and economic growth is generally robust and tested (Wedeman, 2012). But different countries who share the contradictory feature that economy grows as corruption intensifies, require different explanation. Developmental corruption, exemplified by cases including Japan, Korea and Taiwan, reveals the symbiotic relation between the two parts who form a coalition (Wedeman, 2012). Whereas predatory corruption, extracts a toll, irrespective of economy status, like the Zaire case, and without regard for promoting economy in any ways, to which the type of corruption in China resembles in Wedeman’s words. It is arguable whether predatory corruption of China is true or not. Another issue is that the relationship between corruption and economic growth, whether symbiotic or parasitic, remains unclear.  To justify the corruption type in China and derive a conclusion as to symbiotic or parasitic, this essay will connect some papers mainly in political and economic perspective, and extrapolate a little bit.    

The base block to the answer is to know the causes of corruption. From Wedeman, corruption comes as a transformation cost to marketization. The economic reforms fuelled worsening corruption through the controlled and market price spread in the early stage and evolving to siphon off money from the large investment on infrastructure (Wedeman, 2012). It explains how corruption was emerged. While, in Zhu’s view, the causes also come from lack of democratic elements and the embedded agency problem at the drive of complex political structure and linkage with rather centralized power, which then lead to the collective corruption in China (Zhu, 2018). Why corruption intensifies is explained in Zhu’s view. In general, government officials seek profits from their power whenever possible and whenever out of oversight. It is also stated clear from Wedeman that no symbiotic relationship ever exists between the communist party and business; partly based on which, Wedeman categorizes the corruption as predatory (Wedeman, 2012).   

However, it is also stated that government officials hold the incentive to promote economic for future personal gaining, and predictable corruption or stable leadership somehow eases the operation of firms (Zhu, 2017). Implicitly corruption promotes economic growth in this regard, as corruption did in the past to break rigidity of central plans and marketization (Zhu, 2018). Yet before it can be considered as a support for symbiotic relationship that corruption is essential for economic growth, the following case is elaborated.   

In the World Bank Survey of China in 2012, 2700 firms in china aggregately don’t treat corruption a big obstacle of development, rather they treat access to finance as the biggest obstacles; though Zhu elaborated impact of corruption varies to firms of different scale (Zhu, 2017). The two different reactions actually contradict in the sense that corruption plays a big role in the accessing to finance for firms with smaller scale (Galli & Mascia, 2017), and accessing to finance cannot be a big obstacle, if corruption is not a big barrier.  Empirically, access to finance is a smaller problem for bigger firms if corrupt practice can be conducted, which means corrupted officials proactively favoured those more profitable firms and thus corruption is not predatory regarding this. The smaller firms encounter bigger obstacle as constrained to less profitable and risker operational state. However, the selection effect from corruption hinders the robustness of economy in the long run which means even though less predatory corruption is, justified by the argument above, it favours economy contemporarily and is short sited, not to mention the fact that bigger firms are basically state owned which makes the business more prone to corrupt practices.   

State owned business, despite the fact it may hinder robustness of economy, will keep growing with the wing of corruption at the expense of private firm regardless of the relationship between corruption and economy being symbiotic or parasitic. But arguable point is if being symbiotic with economy, corruption should continue facilitate economy as it did in the past. While, for the sake of longterm development, it is suggested that state should retreat and withdraw from the economy regardless of whether it would help or hinder future growth, as it will be irresistible for party members to conduct corrupt practice so long as state play a big role in the economy (Jr, 2013); which contradicts to corruption’s motivation as to enlarge state owned firm. Thus, in consistence with the argument that state should withdraw from business, the relationship between corruption and economy should be parasitic rather than symbiotic.  

At the end, relatively parasitic relationship and relatively predatory type of corruption is justified under some presumption. And the two points involved, as the relationship between access of finance and corruption, and the effect of enlarge state owned business on economy, demand further investigation.
