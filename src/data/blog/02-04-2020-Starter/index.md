[*This is a experiment about not distracted by phone*]
***
I started this experiment on Feb,3,2020, I hope it last for 100 days at least. The basic idea is don't use phone for the day, in class, eating,
or anywhere I have a chance to use my phone. Mobile is a distraction, big distraction to me, I used to watch a lot youtube videos before when I eat,
and that just feels really bad, waste of time and more importantly it chokes with too much information that I couldn't focus on my own study. 

So I decided to do this experiment and write down my feelings of every day and my findings.

For the first day, it's really not hard to stop using phone in the daytime, I kept reading on my laptop, oh speaking of laptop, there is a huge difference 
between mobile phones and laptop. This experiment is not about electronic devices versas traditional media, but rather just phones. Back to what I just said,
in the night, near 11' o'clock, I wanted to use phone very much, I think it's not I miss phone but I am addicted to it and tired of fighting my habbit.

Today everything went normal, but I had a harder time refrain from phone, and I used it at dinner, at class cause I need to take pictures of exams.

Great! Lets see how tomorrow goes!
